Lecture 3:

SQL Statement:

SELECT:（选择）
Ex. SELECT first_name, last_name FROM contacts;

INSERT: （插入）
Ex. INSERT INTO contacts(first_name, last_name)
        VALUES('Fritz', 'Onion');

UPDATE: （修改）
Ex. UPDATE contacts SET last_name = 'Ahern' WHERE id=1;

DELETE: （删除）
Ex. DELETE FROM contacts where id = 2;



SELECT:

Ex. SELECT prod_id, prod_name, prod_price FROM Products;

Ex. SELECT * FROM Products; ---> effective but not recommended (read a huge amount of data)

Ex. SELECT * FROM Products limit 5; ---> limit the amount of data we select

Ex. SELECT DISTINCT vend_id FROM Products ---> avoid selecting repetitive vend_id data from database

Ex. SELECT DISTINCT vend_id, prod_id FROM Products ---> avoid selecting repetitive pairs of vend_id and prod_id from database



Comment:

SELECT prod_id, prod_name, prod_price FROM Products  -- this is a comment

#This is also a comment

/* This is selecting mutiple lines
