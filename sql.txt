Chapter 1: SQL的基本应用




Lecture 1.1:
SQL: Structure Query Language (SQL) is a speicla purpose programming language.
Database: A container to help organize data / a way to efficiently store and retrieve data.

User --SQL---> Database

Why Learnin SQL:
I. At least 80% - 90% of data analysis work is to wrtie SQL query.
II. Almost every data-related job interviews will test SQL.
III. Most of candidates will fail SQL interviews although they have learned it by themselves.

Database ----------> Dataset    ------------------> Model
·Oracle              ·SAS dataset                   ·Regression
·AWS/Google          ·CSV                           ·Decision tree
                     ·txt       ------------------> Busnies Analysis 
                                                    ·Excel

SQL Server Installation: MYSQLWorkbench




Lecture 1.3:

SQL Statement:

SELECT:（选择）
Ex. SELECT first_name, last_name FROM contacts;

INSERT: （插入）
Ex. INSERT INTO contacts(first_name, last_name)
        VALUES('Fritz', 'Onion');

UPDATE: （修改）
Ex. UPDATE contacts SET last_name = 'Ahern' WHERE id=1;

DELETE: （删除）
Ex. DELETE FROM contacts where id = 2;



SELECT(选择):

Ex. SELECT prod_id, prod_name, prod_price FROM Products;

Ex. SELECT * FROM Products; ---> effective but not recommended (read a huge amount of data)

Ex. SELECT * FROM Products limit 5; ---> limit the amount of data we select

Ex. SELECT DISTINCT vend_id FROM Products ---> avoid selecting repetitive vend_id data from database

Ex. SELECT DISTINCT vend_id, prod_id FROM Products ---> avoid selecting repetitive pairs of vend_id and prod_id from database



Comment(注释):

SELECT prod_id, prod_name, prod_price FROM Products  -- this is a comment

#This is also a comment

/* This is selecting mutiple lines
   as comments */











Chapter 2: SQL中的筛选和函数使用


Lecture 2.1:


Order从句进行column排序：

Order By Clause:  (default ascending sort order)

ORDER BY takes the name of one or more columns by which to sort the output.

Ex. SELECT prod_name FROM Products ORDER BY prod_name;  (sort by one single conlumn order)

Ex. SELECT prod_id, prod_price, prod_name FROM Products ORDER BY prod_price, prod_name;  (sort by mutiple columns order)

Ex. SELECT prod_id, prod_price, prod_name FROM Products ORDER BY 2, 3;  (sort by relative position column)


降序排列：

Order by descending order:

SELECT prod_id, prod_price, prod_name FROM Products ORDER BY prod_price DESC;


WHERE从句用于筛选数据：

Filter Data by using Where Clause: 

SELECT ---> FROM ----> WHERE ---> ORDER BY

Ex. SELECT prod_name, prod_price FROM Products WHERE prod_price = 3.49;

Ex. SELECT prod_name, prod_price FROM Products WHERE prod_price BETWEEN 5 AND 10; (inclusive)

Ex. SELECT * From Customers WHERE Cust_email is not NULL; ("is not NUll" refers to non-empty blank)

Ex. SELECT prod_name, prod_price FROM Products WHERE vend_id = 'DLL01" AND prod_price <= 4;





Lecture 2.2:

AND放在OR前面

SQL processes AND operators before OR operators.

Ex. SELECT prod_name, prod_price FROM Products WHERE (vend_id = 'DLL01' OR vend_id = 'BRS01') AND prod_price >= 10;


IN用于代替多个OR

IN operators  ---> used to specify a range of conditions, any of which can be matched (equivalent to a series of "or")

Ex. SELECT prod_name, prod_price, vend_id FROM Products WHERE vend_id IN ('DLL01', 'BRS01'); 


Wildcard筛选（筛选类似数据

WildCard Filtering ---> can be only used with text fields (strings)

1). '%' match any number of occurrences of any character （任意位置筛选）

Ex. SELECT prod_id, prod_name FROM Products WHERE prod_name LIKE 'Fish%';

Ex. SELECT prod_id 

2). '_' macth a single character （固定长度筛选）

Ex. SELECT prod_id, prod_name FROM Products WHERE prod_name LIKE '__inch teddy bear';





Lecutre 2.3: Create Calculated Fields


Rather than retrieve data as it is, what you really want is to retireve converted,
Calculated, or reformatted data directly from the database. 


Concatenating Fields: (组合列)

Ex. SELECT concat(vend_name, ' (', vend_country, ') ') FROM Vendors ORDER BY vend_name;

Aliases: (命名) 

Use Aliases to name the new calculated column 

Ex. SELECT concat(vend_name, ' (', vend_country, ') ') AS vend_title FROM Vendors ORDER BY vend_name;

Calculation: (计算)

Ex. SELECT quantity * item_price AS total_sales, prod_id, quantity, item_price FROM OrderItems WHERE order_num = 20008;



Use Data Manipulation Functions:

1. Extract part of a strings

UPPER() ---> Ex. SELECT vend_name, UPPER (vend_name) AS vend_name_uppercase FROM Vendors ORDER BY vend_name;

SUBSTRING() ---> Ex. SELECT vend_name, SUBSTRING(vend_name, 1, 4) AS first_4_letters_of_vend_name FROM Vendors ORDER BY vend_name;

2. Datatype converstion

YEAR() ---> Ex. SELECT order_num, order_date FROM Orders WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2012;

NOW() ---> Ex. SELECT order_num, order_date, NOW() as currentdateandtime FROM Orders;

3. Get current date

curdate() ---> Return current date as a single column

datediff(curdate(), order_date) ---> Ex. SELECT order_num, order_date NOW() as currentdateandtime, curdate() as curdt, datediff(curdate(), order_date) as dategap FROM Orders;



CASE Expression: (control flow function)

It can be used to conditionally enter into some logic based on the status of a condition being satisfied. Conditions have to be mutually exclusive. 

CASE WHEN [value=compare_value] THEN result

Ex. SELECT prod_price,
        case when prod_price < 6 then 'low price'
	else 'high price'
	end as price_segment
    from Products;



Numeric Functions:

These are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric data, for example, returning absolute numbers and performing algebraic calculations. 

Ex. ABS(), COS(), EXP()....






Chapter 3: 数据的汇总


Lecture 3.1

Examples of Aggregate Functions

1). Determining the number of rows in a table; 
2). Obtaining the sum of a set of rows in a table;
3). Finding the highest, lowest, and average values in a table column


AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM() only five aggregate functions in SQL

AVG() Function - can be used to return the average value of any function:
        Ex.SELECT AVG(prod_price) AS avg_price FROM Products WHERE vend_id = 'DLL01';
        有空值的时候跳过空值，所以计算时的total number会有变化

COUNT() Function -
